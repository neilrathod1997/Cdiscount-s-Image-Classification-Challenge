# Cdiscount-s-Image-Classification-Challenge
This code was used to train Xception model for Kaggle competition Cdiscountâ€™s Image Classification Challenge. In principle, the competition was about standard image classification, however following points made it difficult:

*Large number of categories (5720)
*Big training data (58.2 GB, 7 million products each having up to 4 images)
*A lot of difficult categories (different styles of books and CDs)
*Variable number of images (1-4) for each product
